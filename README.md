# 🐄 Golden Apple Cows (GACOW)

**Golden Apple Cows** is a lightweight Minecraft mod that introduces a new entity and its corresponding spawn egg. This is my first mod, built for the 1.21.11 update (and maybe more to come!).

## ✨ Features
* **Golden Apple Cows**: A rare, custom-textured entity inspired by one of Minecraft's most iconic items.
* **Spawn Egg**: A fully localized item to help you summon Golden Apple Cows in Creative mode.
* **Clean Localization**: Full support for readable in-game names, replacing technical strings with clear titles.

## 🛠️ Building From Source
If you want to build **Golden Apple Cows** from source, clone this repo and run the following in your terminal:

```bash
gradlew build
```

Build files are located in the project's build/libs folder.
